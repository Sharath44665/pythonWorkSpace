# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

#     on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder

#     except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder

#     unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder

# e.g. The year 2000:

# 2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)

# 2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

# 2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)
# So the year 2000 is a leap year.

if year%4 == 0:
  if year%100 ==0:

      print("Leap year")
    else:
      print("Not leap year")
  else:
    print("Leap year")
else:
  print("Not leap year")
